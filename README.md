# XXE Lab

This virtual environment is a simple php web application that contains an example of an XML eXternal Entity vulnerability.

For a guided walkthrough have a look at (our blog post)[#todo].

It is designed by [Joshua Barone](https://github.com/jbarone/xxelab).
We re-organized the project to be suitable for our blog.
